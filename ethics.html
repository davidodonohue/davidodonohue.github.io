<h1>Ethics</h1>
<p>
This is a collection of thoughts about life. The roadmap is draft -> polished draft -> visual styling.
<p>
<h3>Happiness, goals, power, and values</h3><p>
Happiness is a transient state, and whatever the state of a person's life is, they have the capacity to eventually reach a point
 of psychological homeostasis, where when something more rewarding than usual happens, they will feel happiness for a short
 period of time, and if something less rewarding than usual happens, they will feel flatter for a short period of time.
 Pursuing happiness, then, doesn't seem like the best use of time.
 <p>
What should we pursue, then? Some people suggest we pursue goals, some people suggest we try to live in line with our core values,
 but I think it's also important to pursue power. I'll define power generally as anything which allows you to have a greater influence
 on your environment than you otherwise would have. Sources of power are context-dependent, and could include intelligence, knowledge,
 attractiveness, health, strength, fitness, friendships, bravery, patience, charisma, money, etc.
 <p>
Why should you pursue power? Power can help you to alter your environment to be more conducive to achieving your goals, or proliferating your values. Hopefully this is convincing enough.
 <p>
How should you prioritise the pursuit of these factors? Since they take time to achieve, I think they should be prioritised based on how transient or impactful they are.
 For example, don't sacrifice your values for power, because the whole point
 of power is that it can help you survive/thrive without sacrificing your values. At the same time, I'd say that if you have a goal to lose 5kg with a diet,
 and someone offers you $12 million dollars to each a block of chocolate, then you should probably do it and then just get liposuction. The frustrating thing
 about bureaucracy is that people place a higher value on the processes put in place to achieve a goal rather than the goal itself, so you have to assess the
 relative magnitude/transience of each option to avoid shooting yourself in the foot when you have to pick between these pursuits.
 <p>
It's also important to remember that goals change. This can mean that pursuing power, which will make future goals easier to achieve, is sometimes
 recommended over the pursuit of less well developed or more ephemereal goals.
 <h3>Hormesis</h3><p>
An inverted U shaped graph appears quite frequently in many different settings between "bad stuff" and "good outcomes". Some examples are hormesis, vaccines, flow state
 during slightly difficult activities, strength or endurance gain after stressing the muscle, autophagy after fasting, increased VO2 max after carbon dioxide tolerance
 training, increased social/professional effectiveness when pushing your comfort zone, post-traumatic growth, integration of the Jungian shadow following a strangely upsetting experience etc. Some relevant quotes are:
 <p>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.</br>
The dose makes the poison.<br>
If you do what's easy, your life will be hard. However, if you do what's hard, your life will be easy.<br>
<p>
However, it's not actually true that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Plenty of people have bad things happen to them, and don't end up better off.
 This is due to the extreme right-hand side of the inverted U graph, where things which are <i>too</i> bad or difficult don't increase positive outcomes. This
 concept is interesting to me. What are the factors which contribute to the "good" outcomes in the middle of the graph (mid stress), and what are the factors
 that contribute to the dips at either end of the graph (no stress or too much stress)?
 <p>
My current theory on the reason for the inverted U graph is that as stress goes up, motivation to adapt to or overcome the stress increases, but available resources
 decrease. If each of these factors were limiting factors on the outcome, this would produce an an inverted U graph. Positive outcomes and motivation increase the more stress is applied, up until the point
 where the limiting factor switches from lack of motivation to lack of resources, after which any increase in stress will cause a further decrease in resources, and a decrease in positive outcomes as a result.
 This is how vaccines work, they mobilise the immune system without overwhelming it.
 <p>
<h3>Exploiting hormesis</h3><p>
If we understand the factors which contribute to this inverted U-shape graph, we have possible targets for intervention. 
<p>
<h3>Matthew effect</h3><p>
For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
<p>
<h3>Jungian shadow</h3><p>
Jungian shadow
<p>
<h3>Distress tolerance</h3><p>
Our distress can cause us to act in a way which is counter to both our values and our pursuit of power/goals. Virtues such as patience (tolerance of boredom or
 waiting), bravery (tolerance of fear), and perserverance (tolerance of failure), among others, allow you to better act in line with your values or the pursuit of power
 and can be improved by increasing your tolerance to distress.<p>
<h3>Outside the comfort zone</h3><p>
Since our intelligent civilisation makes many things so much easier for us, to achieve balance we sometimes need to force ourselves out of our comfort zone.
 Getting into the habit of stepping out of our comfort zone also increases our distress tolerance, which will allow us to be unrestrained by it. Do something against your natural instincts every day.
<p>
<h3>Stoicism</h3><p>
Everything that happens has a good and a bad. The goal is to frame or focus on what you need to, to move closer towards the middle of the inverted U.
<h3>Tenken Jinshin Onikiri Reforged</h3><p>
The following are biographical quotes from a character in the mobile game Onmyoji.<p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">Fire, endless fire is engulfing my body.
A forging hammer is slamming at me through that bluish fire. Sparks splash when it lands on me.
My broken blades have been melted in the fire and turned into something soft as water. The hammer keeps beating the body of the blade. With repeated hammering, the body of my blade has been folded millions of times. I have been folded millions of times and turned into liquid steel in a process of endless pain.
The terrible pain of forging has ignited my memories with my demon flame as if I was victorious in desperation.
The pain was the training I had when I killed demons and monsters for the Minamoto Clan. It was my frenzy when I shed blood in the Minamoto Residence, trying to take all lives, including mine. The forging hammer beat me repeatedly. I thought of the battle in Mt. Oe when I was determined to sacrifice myself to shatter that sea monster's field. Every pain that I've gone through has broken me in the end.
And that iron hammer just kept striking down on me, bringing frustration and torture. Yet it made my flame burn brighter and made me more tenacious.
I had a heart, hard as steel, but fragile. Every pain I've gone through has fed this fire and the hammering that burns me and strikes me again and again.
I asked this furnace of fire to grant me an unbending heart, a determined heart.</blockquote><p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">After the blade core was forged, my body began to burn crimson red like the rising sun. To put my soul back in the blade, Minamoto no Yorimitsu stabbed the red hot blade into the ice cold blood pact. The edge started to bend in a mist of blood. Fire was sucked into the blade, revealing a newly forged edge.
And my humanoid form was finally formed in the darkness and fell from the rift into the other world. My first footstep was a thud, and painful but not lost.
I squared my shoulders and raised my head to find a man before me. I noticed the change in my body. Just when I was about to speak, the man said,
"Your blade body has been reforged and you are still regaining power, so this look is how you look now. When you regain your power, your body will return to how you were before."
"And the best way to heal is through practice. You were forged in the Minamoto Clan and this is the fastest way for you to recover. We now owe each other nothing. You can leave if you want."
I thought for a while. The fire of the furnace was the road home he gave me. Since he lit the fire for me, I had no reason to turn down the favour. So I nodded.
"I will escape no more. This is my best whet stone. When I regain my power, I will challenge you to a fair duel."
Minamoto no Yorimitsu looked surprised. The forging of the blade was an unplanned event that was completed in a hurry. He still had his sleeves rolled up. It was then I discovered the layers of bandages wrapped around his arms and covered in blood. He burst out laughing and held the newly forged blade in his hand and presented it to me.
"I look forward to it."</blockquote><p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">When I first arrived at the Minamoto Clan, I was taught how to forge blades.
Forging a great blade is a lengthy process. Forged with fire, cooled with earth plating, quenched with water, polished with gold, and preserved with wood.
If you use hard steel, the blade will be sharp but also easy to break. The harder it is, the easier it will be to bend it or break it. If you use soft steel, the blade might not be so easy to break, but it won't be sharp. And the edge will curl up after a few slashes.
The best warrior blade is a balance between hard and soft. This opposition makes a blade strong and tenacious. Through hammering millions of times in the fiercest of furnaces, a blade can have the sharpest edge and the most tenacious core. It will be the most powerful blade of all.
I will be the most powerful blade of all. From now on, I will use the Minamoto Clan as my whet stone and the blade in my hand as my faith. I wield my blade following only my heart, to end all evil thoughts in the world.
I am Onikiri, the blade that will end all your evil delusions.</blockquote><p>
Be like Onikiri. Use hardships to become stronger, integrate your shadow to have more insight into yourself and a more stable identity, and find a balance between comfort and distress.<p>
