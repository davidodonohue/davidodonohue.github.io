We can think about the concept of virtue in two different ways. The first way is that virtue is about following the rules laid out by some kind of external moral authority.
This seems to be the case in Christianity, and is also the backbone of the police/prison system. This conceptualisation of virtue has the consequence that some people decide to rebel,
while others become sanctimonious. There is unnecessary punishment, judgement, and shame.

<br><br>

Another way of conceptualising virtue is that there are certain behaviours which have a high probability of increasing your well-being, and certain behaviours which
have a high probability of decreasing your well-being. Actions which increase your well-being are considered virtuous, and actions which decrease your well-being are considered vices.
This is how the ancient Greek philosophers conceptualised virtue, and they spent most of their time wondering about what counts as well-being, and what actions might lead to an
increase or decrease in well-being. Under this model, both rebellion and sanctimony don't make much sense. There is no external moral authority to rebel against, and consistently
engaging in actions which promote your own well-being isn't really much of a basis to claim that you are "better" than someone else.

<br><br>

As a quick example, let's look at premarital sex. In the days where no one knew much about how pregnancy worked, or what STDs were, and contraception/safe sex/medical treatments
didn't exist, the practice of premarital sex would have a high chance of either an unwanted/unexpected pregnancy, the contraction of a possibly lethal disease, or both. It would
very much have been in the best interests of each individual to not engage in premarital sex, or even to marry someone who had engaged in premarital sex. In these circumstances,
premarital sex can be considered a vice, purely for the reason that it is very likely to go very badly for you. These days, however, the argument that premarital sex is a vice, from
the ancient Greeks' conceptualisation of virtue, is much weaker.

<br><br>

I much prefer the second conceptualisation, for several reasons. Firstly, we can actually empirically study which behaviours tend to have a positive impact on our lives, and which
behaviours don't. We don't have to wonder about what some supernatual moral authority wishes us to do, complain about what it is that they want us to do, be punished for not doing it,
or punish other people (or ourselves) for not following some apparently arbitrary set of rules.

<br><br>

What follows are my own ideas about virtue.

<br><br>

There are several steps to acting virtuously:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Gather all of the relevant information</span><br>
This requires <span class="highlighted">open-mindedness</span>, to avoid disregarding potentially valid information;<br>
<span class="highlighted">perceptiveness</span>, to be able to take note of new information;<br>
and <span class="highlighted">distress tolerance</span>, to be able to examine parts of yourself or your environment that you find aversive.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Logically process the information to make inferences</span><br>
This requires <span class="highlighted">logical thinking</span>, to avoid making decisions based on things you think are true, but are not.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Maximise the options you have available to you</span><br>
This requires <span class="highlighted">creativity</span>, to see the options which exist;<br>
<span class="highlighted">experience</span> can also help here;<br>

<span class="highlighted">social skills</span> and friendships will lead to more goodwill, and subsequently more possible options or resources;<br>
<span class="highlighted">influence</span>, such as wealth, status, attractiveness etc will also open doors for you.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Choose the best option according to your own values, temperament, and abilities</span><br>
This requires <span class="highlighted">self-insight</span> and <span class="highlighted">foresight</span>.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Follow through on the course of action you choose to take</span><br>
The ancient Greeks have a term for acting against one's better judgement, called "akrasia". Following through on the course of action you choose to take requires <span class="highlighted">willpower</span>.

<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">6) Miscellaneous</span><br>
These things are requires throughout each stage.<br>
Be <span class="highlighted">grateful</span>, yet <span class="highlighted">unattached</span>, to what you have.<br>
Develop the ability to <span class="highlighted">sublimate</span> various "negative" emotions or events into positive opportunities or motivations.

<br><br>

I will continually update this treatise, and expand on each of the attributes I believe are necessary for virtue in separate treastises. In particular, I plan to focus on distress tolerance and willpower.
